## Hi there, it's SG ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscientist specializing in auditory perception by training.
- ðŸŽ¶ Before that, I had an education in Western musical composition.
- ðŸ¤– I'm currently interested in how computational models can help us understand how musical information is processed in evoking emotions in our brains.
- ðŸ“› My first name (ìŠ¹êµ¬) reads [/sÉ¯Å‹gu/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=/s%C9%AF%C5%8B-gu/&voice=Joey), of which the first vowel may be difficult to guess from its Romanization. For the sake of unambiguity, I used to ask those who could not learn this Korean vowel to call me "SG" (Es-Gee). Sometimes "SG" sounds alright to me. But other times I do appreciate it when people make efforts and finally learn it. I just believe the "true nerd" ðŸ¤“ knows how to read IPA, and musicians have good ears.
- ðŸ¤¬ Oh yes, apparently, I love venting.
