## Hi there, it's Seung-Goo! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscientist specializing in auditory perception by training.
- ðŸŽ¶ Before that, I had an education in Western musical composition.
- ðŸ¤– I'm currently interested in how computational models can help us understand how musical information is processed in evoking emotions in our brains.
- ðŸ“› My first name ("Seung-Goo" in the [Revised Romanization of Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean); "ìŠ¹êµ¬" in the [Korean alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)) reads [/sÉ¯Å‹gu/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=/s%C9%AF%C5%8B-gu/&voice=Joey) in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), of which the first vowel may be difficult to guess from its Romanization. I think "Sng-Gu" might be easier, like the famous "Andy Ng". To avoid embarrassment, I used to ask those who could not learn this Korean vowel to call me "SG" (Es-Gee). Mostly "SG" sounds okay to me. But other times I do appreciate it when my colleagues and friends make efforts to learn it. I just believe a "true nerd"ðŸ¤“ knows how to read the IPA and musiciansðŸŽ¹ have good ears.
- ðŸ¤¬ Oh yes, apparently, I love ranting.
